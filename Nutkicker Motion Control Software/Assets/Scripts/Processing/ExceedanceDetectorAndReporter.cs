/* 
 * This Class is responsible for detecting a threshold exceedance in a datastream. Whenever an exceedance is present, it will...
 * 
 * 1. Block the downstream propagation of the exceedance value
 * 2. Send the last good value (that was present before the exceedance ocurred) downstream instead
 * 3. Raise an "exceedance event" to alert the crash detector ONCE!
 * 4.
