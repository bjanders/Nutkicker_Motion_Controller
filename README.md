# Nutkicker_Motion_Controller

--> DO NOT USE FOR ACTUAL MOTION CUEING OF AN ACTUAL PLATFORM YET! <--

Motion cueing software to read motion data out of DCS World. The processed data shall eventually be used to drive a 6DOF Stewart-type platform.

Beginners:
1. Go to ..\Nutkicker_Motion_Controller\LUA and copy the Export.lua file to the clipboard.
2. Go to [UserName]\Saved Games\DCS\Scripts and MAKE A BACKUP of your Export.lua (if existing).
3. Paste the Export.lua from the clipboard into the [UserName]\Saved Games\DCS\Scripts folder.
4. Go to ..\Nutkicker_Motion_Controller\Nutkicker Motion Control Software\Builds\NMC_Development_Build and run "Nutkicker Motion Control Software".
5. Click "Start Server" in the "Sim Connect" Window. The indicator will turn yellow.
6. Start DCS, start a mission and unpause. The motion data should flow but the platform will not be moving yet. It is still parked.
7. You will be able to see the platform moving only after you go into the "Platform Control" window and click on [Park-->Pause] and then on [Pause --> Motion]


Let me know if you run in to problems.

Dirt-e :-)
